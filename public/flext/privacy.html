        <h1 class="mb-5 border-b font-semibold text-2xl">Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This policy (the <strong>Policy</strong>) sets out various procedures that will be followed
        by Michael Camilleri (the <strong>Developer</strong>) in connection with the iOS application,
        Flext (the <strong>App</strong>). The Policy applies to all information collected or
        submitted in, or as a result of your use of, the App.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 border-b font-semibold text-xl">The Information</h2>
        <h3 class="mt-3 font-semibold text-lg">Collection</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">The App does not collect any information directly. Information relating to your
        use of the App may be shared with the Developer by Apple, Inc. (<strong>Apple</strong>) if
        you consent to submit diagnostic information to third-party developers.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Information relating to your use of the App may be collected if you agree to
        participate in the testing of versions of the App that have not been publicly
        released. An example of this is if you agree to test the App using Apple's
        TestFlight service.</p>
        <h4 class="mt-3 font-semibold">GitHub</h4>
        <p class="mt-2">The source code to the App is made available through a code-hosting service
        (the <strong>Repository</strong>) operated by GitHub, Inc. (<strong>GitHub</strong>). The Developer also
        uses the Repository to collect reports on errors relating to the App.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Any information received or collected by the Developer as a result of your use
        of the Repository will be subject to the Policy. However, information received
        or collected by GitHub is not subject to the terms of the Policy. GitHub's
        privacy policy is available on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement">their website</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-3 font-semibold text-lg">Usage</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">The Developer uses any information collected or received to operate and improve
        the App and provide support to users of the App.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">The Developer will not share personally identifiable information with third
        parties. The Developer may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with third
        parties. An example of such a statistic is the number of people who have
        downloaded the App.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">The Developer may disclose information: (a) in response to subpoenas, court
        orders, or other legal requirements; (b) to exercise the Developer's legal
        rights or defend against legal claims; (c) to investigate, prevent, or take
        action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of
        the Developer's policies; or (d) to protect the Developer's rights and property.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">In the future, the Developer may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with
        other entities. In such transactions, information collected or received may be
        among the transferred assets.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-3 font-semibold text-lg">Security</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">The Developer implements a variety of security measures to help keep
        information collected or received secure. Primarily this involves storing
        information in such a way that it can only be accessed by an authorised user.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 border-b font-semibold text-xl">Your Rights</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">You may request access to, change of or deletion of information collected or
        received by the Developer.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are
        encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">The Developer may delete your information at any time and for any reason.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 border-b font-semibold text-xl">Regulatory Compliance</h2>
        <h3 class="mt-3 font-semibold text-lg">California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">The Developer complies with the California Online Privacy Protection Act to the
        extent applicable. The Developer will not distribute your personal information
        to outside parties without your consent.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-3 font-semibold text-lg">Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">The Developer does not collect or maintain information from persons the
        Developer knows are under 13 years of age, and no part of the App is structured
        to attract anyone under 13 years of age.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-3 font-semibold text-lg">European Union Users</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">By using the App and providing any information, you authorise the Developer to
        collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-3 font-semibold text-lg">International Transfers</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which
        you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different
        laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored
        or used.</p>
